# Interpretable_Machine_Learning_Applications
In this project, we learned how to create interpretable machine learning applications on the example of two classification regression models, decision tree and random forestc classifiers. We also learned how to explain such prediction models by extracting the most important features and their values, which mostly impact these prediction models.
